Door Lock System

The Door Lock System is a simple yet effective security device that can be used in a variety of settings, such as factories, schools, homes, and offices. This project uses the Assembly language and the Irvine library, which must be imported into the project in order for it to work properly.

How It Works

The system prompts the user to enter a password. If the password is correct, the device will open the door. If the user enters the administrator password, they will be able to change the password of the door lock system. However, if the user enters the password incorrectly three times in a row, they will be locked out of the system and only allowed access again if they enter the administrator password.

Usage

To use the Door Lock System, first import the Irvine library into the project. Then, compile and run the code. When prompted, enter the appropriate password to either open the door or change the password.

Important Note

Please be aware that the Door Lock System will not work without the Irvine library. Be sure to import the library into your project before attempting to use the Door Lock System.
